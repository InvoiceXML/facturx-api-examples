# Embed an existing UN/CEFACT CII XML into an existing PDF, producing a
# Factur-X compliant PDF/A-3 hybrid invoice.
#
# Your PDF keeps its exact layout, fonts, and branding; the API promotes the
# container to PDF/A-3 and attaches the XML as factur-x.xml. The XML is
# validated with the full /v1/validate/facturx rule set first, so a
# non-compliant invoice never leaves the API.
